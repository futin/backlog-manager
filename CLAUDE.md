# backlog-manager

Claude Code plugin repo: four backlog skills — `backlog`, `backlog-capture`,
`backlog-groom`, `backlog-execute` — plus a local NestJS + React app that
shows every registered project's backlog on one kanban-by-type board. No
database: the registry file and each project's `backlog/` directory are the
data.

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Whole stack (api + client, no db) | `pnpm run docker:up` |
| Rebuild the stack from scratch | `pnpm run docker:sync` |
| API only, on the host | `pnpm run dev` |
| Client only, on the host | `pnpm run dev:web` |
| Tests | `pnpm test` (jest, `--runInBand`) |
| Skill tests | `pnpm run test:skills` |
| Reinstall the plugin from the pushed HEAD | `pnpm run plugin:sync` |
| Types | `pnpm run typecheck` |
| Production build | `pnpm run build` |

Ports: API `4322`, Vite `5177` (guide-manager holds 4321/5175/5176 on this
machine). Only the host side moves, via `BM_API_PORT` / `BM_WEB_PORT` in
`.env` — inside the compose stack they are fixed.

## Layout

- `server/src/` — Nest: `health/`, `items/` (`/api/items`, `/api/projects`,
  `/api/items/body`), `agents/` (the one outbound-calling module — status,
  plan, dispatch), `registry/` (read-only view of the registry file),
  `static.ts` (serves `client/dist` only when built).
- `client/src/` — React SPA: side rail (Projects / Settings), board (four
  fixed columns — bugs/ideas/tasks/out-of-scope — card drawer, dispatch
  control opening a launch sheet onto `../claude-agents-dashboard`),
  Settings. Fed by `lib/agents.ts` (same-origin fetches) and
  `hooks/useAgents.ts` (status poll on mount and window focus).
- `shared/` — `types.ts` (all shared shapes), `agent.ts` (`deriveAction`,
  `dispatchGate` — see Invariants), `theme.css` (five theme palettes).
- `skills/backlog/`, `skills/backlog-capture/`, `skills/backlog-groom/`,
  `skills/backlog-execute/` — the skills this repo publishes.
  `skills/backlog/tools/backlog.mjs` is the CLI every skill calls and the
  registry's only writer.
- `backlog/` — this repo's own backlog, self-registered like any project.
- `scripts/sync-plugin.mjs` — reinstalls the plugin from the pushed HEAD.
- `docs/superpowers/` — design spec and implementation plan.

## Invariants

Full rationale for the longer ones: [docs/invariants.md](docs/invariants.md).
Read it before changing any of these — most encode a failure that already
happened.

- **`skills/` is the plugin skill root**; never duplicate it under
  `.claude/skills/` — that loads the same skills twice and drifts.
- **`~/.backlog-manager/registry.json` has exactly one writer**:
  `skills/backlog/tools/backlog.mjs` (`init`/`new` upsert). The server
  re-reads it per request, never writes, never caches.
- **Item files are read-only to the server and client**; every write goes
  through the skills. Dispatch writes no item files either — the spawned
  session runs the skills, which remain the only writers.
- **Every server route lives under `/api`**; the Vite proxy has exactly one
  entry, asserted by `test/vite-proxy.test.ts`.
- **Item bodies are served through a registry-built allowlist**
  (`allow.util.ts`); a file outside every registered `backlog/` 404s.
- **Groomed is derived** (bug: Cause+Fix filled and not "unknown"; task: Plan
  non-empty), never stored; status is the directory, never frontmatter.
- **`started: YYYY-MM-DD` is the one lifecycle key allowed in frontmatter,
  and it is not a status** — the `status:` ban stands. Written only by
  `start`/`stop`, which must round-trip unknown keys and the body
  byte-for-byte; "in progress" is decided in the client.
- **Editing `skills/` changes nothing until it is committed, pushed, and
  `pnpm run plugin:sync` runs.** An install is a copy of the pushed HEAD,
  never the working tree — git is the publishing boundary, and the sync
  refuses dirty/unpushed/behind states. New skills load on the next Claude
  Code restart.
- **Both processes bind `127.0.0.1` by default; loopback is the access
  control** (nothing has auth). `BM_BIND` is the single knob; compose sets
  `0.0.0.0` because there the loopback *publish* is the boundary.
- **The served build carries a CSP (`server/src/security.ts`); dev does
  not.** `script-src` pins the pre-paint theme script's sha256 — edit that
  script and `test/csp.test.ts` goes red until `THEME_SCRIPT_SHA256` follows.
- **Container mounts land on host paths, read-only**, because the registry
  stores absolute host paths.
- **pnpm only**, pinned by `packageManager`, enforced via corepack in the
  image.
- **`allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` lists `esbuild`**; a skipped build
  surfaces as Vite failing to start.
- **Editing `vite.config.ts` needs `docker compose restart client`.**
- **Backlog items move `open/` → `done/`; `out-of-scope/` is flat.**
- **Dispatch derives the action; it never accepts one.** `deriveAction`
  (`shared/agent.ts`) is the single implementation for the board's label and
  the server's validation; dispatch re-scans the file and 409s on
  disagreement. The prompt is the only client field taken outright; unknown
  `model`/`effort` drop rather than reject. The controller rebuilds the
  dispatch body field by field — a new field reaches the service only when
  added there too.
- **The browser never talks to the dashboard.** Every call goes board → this
  API → dashboard; `BM_AGENTS_URL` is env-only; `BM_AGENTS` defaults to off.
- **A project the dashboard cannot see cannot be dispatched to.** Never
  derive a `dirName` from a path to route around this. The `dispatchGate`
  membership check is a raw string compare, deliberately not realpath.
- **An environment-level block hides the dispatch control; only the per-item
  (project-visibility) one disables it.** With `BM_AGENTS` off the board
  shows no dispatch buttons — do not "improve" that into disabled buttons.
- **The two agents POSTs are guarded by content-type and origin**
  (`server/src/agents/origin.guard.ts`) — the one place loopback is NOT the
  access control. Absent `Origin` stays allowed; the guard compares host and
  port, not scheme.
- **The launch sheet's model/effort pickers seed from Settings, never the
  last launch** (`dispatchDefaultModel` / `dispatchDefaultEffort` in
  `client/src/lib/settings.ts`, clamped against `MODELS`/`EFFORTS`).
  Permission mode has no stored default — it comes from `plan.defaultMode`,
  clamped to the host ceiling.
- **`linkBase` becomes an href**, so `clampSettings` routes it through
  `clampOrigin` — URL-parsed, `http(s)` only. The one settings key a
  hand-edited localStorage value could turn into script execution.

## Conventions

- Comments explain *why*, at length, and the existing density is deliberate —
  match it rather than stripping it.
- Tests are flat in `test/`, `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`; component suites opt
  into jsdom with a `@jest-environment jsdom` docblock. Skill tests live next
  to the tool they cover (`skills/*/tools/*.test.mjs`) and run under node's
  own test runner, not jest.
