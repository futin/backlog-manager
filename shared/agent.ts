/**
 * What the board should do with this item's dispatch control, and why.
 *
 * The three cases are not three severities of the same thing — they are two
 * genuinely different kinds of "no", and the UI owes them different answers:
 *
 *  - `hidden` — an ENVIRONMENT-level block: dispatch is off, the dashboard is
 *    unreachable, it has no `CLAUDE_BIN`, its remote answers are off. None of
 *    those is about this card, none is fixable from the board, and all four
 *    are true of every card at once. A disabled control on all forty of them
 *    is noise the reader cannot act on, so the control is not rendered at all.
 *    This is also what makes the promise the spec and `.env.example` both
 *    make — with `BM_AGENTS` off the board "renders exactly as it does today"
 *    and "shows no dispatch buttons" — literally true.
 *  - `disabled` — a PER-ITEM block: the dashboard cannot see this item's
 *    project. That one IS about this card, it is fixable (open a session
 *    there, or raise the dashboard's `LOOKBACK_HOURS`), and it names a path,
 *    so a control that states the reason is worth more than silence. It is
 *    precisely the behaviour chosen when the lookback limit was accepted
 *    rather than worked around.
 *  - `enabled` — nothing is in the way.
 *
 * Ordered most-fundamental first so the reason names the thing to fix rather
 * than a symptom of it: with BM_AGENTS off there is nothing to say about
 * reachability.
