 * downstream crash the moment a consumer reads a missing field, in the same
 * request/response round trip that produced it. `AgentsStatus` is different:
 * it is cached in `useAgents`' state and re-read by every card on the board,
 * so a bad shape does not fail once, it lies quietly to every consumer for as
 * long as that state sticks around. This is where the cast is made honest —
 * checking every field `dispatchBlock` (`shared/agent.ts`) actually
 * dereferences, in the order it dereferences them, so nothing downstream can
 * read `undefined` as false-y or throw on a missing `.projectPaths`.
